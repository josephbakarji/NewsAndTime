Make website that identifies fake news within a dynamic of changing meaning.
The news is a reflection of a flow of understanding, values and meaning.
The flow is dynamic and is reflected in the motion of words around others.

The distributional representation vector of words in high dimensional space reflect some sort of understanding.
Those words move between day and night, between season and the next, and at various time scales.
But as the words move in flow clusters can be identified:
Some words are attached to each other like atomic bonds.
Some words are oscillating in space reflecting in oscillation in the physical world.
Some words are stagnant and always maintain a fixed relationship between them.
Some words are bonded by some sort of elasticity, viscoplasticity or any of the variants.
That space of words flows in a fashion to parallel the flow of what is happening in the real world.
Can we draw a correlation between the oscillation of words in this space with words carried by 'night' and 'day'.

The idea is thus to cluster words in a space according to their dynamics (velocities) and bonds (forces).
Words that are rigidly attached must be a form of grammar or necessary logic.
Words that flow from one cluster to another are switchy and inaccurate.
The clustering methodology is derived from various measures of relative dynamics.
In this case, we speak of p(x|v, t) the conditional probability of position given a velocity.
And we extend concepts of dynamics (like force) to the space of semantics.

Understanding the laws governing the flow of words in that space
Is in fact a form of sematics because the flow mimics the physical world.
Thus, the correlations reveal a different scale of society and man.
A proper approach to modeling the data.

The modeling procedure is a matter of mapping words which we know their characteristic in a certain context.
For example the sentence: "I found the box and I took the object out of it".
Can the space of meaning of words and a proper measure of relation between them be reflected in a motion of the space.
Can the space of meanings (where the design of its measure is to be determined) reflect by analogy the space of words?
For example, meaning revolves around "I", and "Me". Depending on where you look, writing also revolve around 'man', 'human'.



A sentence is made of a certain flow of information from a word to another within that space.

Let u_ij be an n*m space of sematics and let A_ijkl be the transformation of the space from t to t+dt.
In other words:
	--
	u_ij(t+dt) = A_ijkl * u_kl(t)
	--
	u_ij(t+dt) - u_ij(t) = A_ijkl u_kl(t) - \delta_{ijkl} u_kl(t)
	--
	du_ij = (A_ijkl - \delta_ijkl) u_kl(t)

Or something like that.

Clusters of words dynamics can be captured by finding 'fixed' clusters of words in wordspace-time
And the words that move can be related to others by description of their 'acceleration' and thus semantic 'force'.
The dynamic relationship between words is after all a reflection of the relative properties of words;
And anyway, we know that knowledge is also always relative.

Analogy is the core of cognition and it is the only means to understanding.
Taking this into account, learning is making an analogy between what's unknown and what is known.

New words and new concepts are born with time and they reflect our obsessions, problems and evolution.
In the space of semantics words are born out of other words and they live and die like gods.
Gods like words are analogies in the first place and they only point at an ontological relationship we have with our surrounding.
Pain and Happiness are not forms of information but rather embedded in the 'thing' that we are.

Now back to the question of how do you construct that semantic space?
The clusters are captured by using mixture of gaussians to model the pdf of the word positions.
Words would be like electrons attracted to their nucleous center.
The way those words are put into this space reflect various dynamics of description reflecting the real world.

A sematic similarity distirbution representation models a first order relationship between words without structure.
[Can the structure be learned from the dynamics itself? Can the model of modeling words be learned? For example stopwords act as fundamental meaning transformations to other words as reflected in the structure of the sentence.]

An example of hierarchical clustering levels is that of analogy done in word2vec space.
Strong-Stronger-Strongest can be connected in that space the 'same way' Big-Bigger-Biggest are.
The trio will form a 'shape' that reflects their relationship.
Finding all such trios a a higher level of clustering modifying the relations in the space (not clear how)

Questions such as this also have to be answered:
Can we find the number of clusters (objects) in a simulation (movie) from the dynamics (taking into account motion of contiguous points)
