This file takes the data of the three models, NB, Linreg and PCA+GDA, in the form of a set of tables, where each row is and article and different columns are the probability of that article being assigned to the year corresponding to the column.

It then produces the plots of each model and also the combination NB+Linreg model and computes the probability and error standard deviation.
